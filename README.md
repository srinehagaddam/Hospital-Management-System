# Hospital-Management-System
The project is aimed to develop to maintain the day-to-day state of  admission/discharge of patients, list of doctors, reports generation etc.
 It is designed to achieve the following objectives:
 To computerize all the details regarding patients and hospitals.
 Scheduling the appointment of patients with doctors to make it 
convenient for both.
 Scheduling the services of specialized doctors and emergencies 
properly so that facilities provided by hospitals are fully utilized in 
an effective and efficient manner
 The information of the patients should be kept up to date and 
their record should be kept in the system for historical purposes.
 To make the website as user friendly as possible

The scope of this proposal system includes working within numerous data, with ease. The system will be used in any Hospital, Clinic, Dispensary or Pathology labs in any Hospital, Clinic, Dispensary or Pathology labs to get the information from the patients and then storing that data for future usage. The current system in use is a paper-based system. It is too slow and cannot provide updated lists of patients within a reasonable timeframe. The intentions of the system are to reduce over-time pay and increase the number of patients that can be treated accurately. The system also provides excellent security of data at every level of user -
system interaction and also provides robust and reliable storage and backup facilities.
